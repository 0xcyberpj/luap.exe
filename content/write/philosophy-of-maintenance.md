## letter 1 — body

I start every maintenance window with a stretch and a promise: *do not rush*. Machines respond to the energy you carry toward them.

> “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.” — Simone Weil

- Drink water before touching the keyboard.
- Note how the room smells; it will help you remember the night later.

## letter 2 — mind

- Write down the thing you fear will break.
- Imagine it already broke and you survived. Now fix it in reality.

```
fear -> story -> calm -> action
```

## letter 3 — spirit

Maintenance is a love language. This letter is for future me who will read it at 2 AM and remember that caring is the whole point.

- Thank the past engineers aloud, even if they can’t hear you.
- Leave a gentle message in the logs for whoever touches the system next.
