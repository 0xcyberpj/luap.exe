I started writing night letters to future me so I could give honest status reports without the varnish of daylight.

1. **Context.** I summarize the day in three sentences—what hurt, what worked, what confused me.
2. **A quote.** I end each entry with something I read that made me feel less alone. Last night it was: “Loneliness is not solitude, it is the longing for integration.” — David Whyte.
3. **A promise.** Future me gets one small, humane task. “Drink water before opening Slack” counts.

These letters make every project feel more human, which is the only way I stay curious enough to keep shipping.
