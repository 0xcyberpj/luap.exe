## Why this corner exists

I needed a quiet place on the internet to stash experiments, debug transcripts, and the tech write-ups I wish existed when I got stuck. Everything here is intentionally short, practical, and a little opinionated.

## Fresh writing

- [placeholder post title](/write/placeholder)

## What you’ll find

1. **Thoughts** – brain dumps on how I’m wiring tools together or unlearning bad habits.
2. **Tech writeups** – cleaner guides, usually after the chaos settles.
3. **Signals** – occasional pointers to talks, repos, or specs I’m circling.

## Lonely lines I’m living with
